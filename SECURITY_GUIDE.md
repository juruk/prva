# Security Guide - Password Protection

## üîê Overview

Your Construction Project Manager application is now protected with password authentication. This guide explains how the security system works and how to customize it.

---

## üéØ Access Levels

The application supports two access levels:

### 1. **Admin Access**
- **Full permissions**: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
- Can add new projects, architects, and contractors
- Can edit and delete all data
- Can manage project phases and assignments
- Can import and export data
- Badge displayed: **"Admin"** with shield icon

### 2. **Read-Only Access**
- **View-only permissions**: Can only view data
- Cannot create, edit, or delete anything
- All Add/Edit/Delete buttons are hidden
- Can export data for viewing
- Cannot import data
- Badge displayed: **"Read-Only"** with eye icon

---

## üîë Default Passwords

The application comes with default passwords that **MUST be changed** before deployment:

```javascript
// Located in: src/components/Login.jsx

const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'admin123'        // Change this!
const READONLY_PASSWORD = 'view123'      // Change this!
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Change Passwords

### Step 1: Open the Login Component

Navigate to: `src/components/Login.jsx`

### Step 2: Locate the Password Constants

Find these lines (around line 9-10):

```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'admin123'
const READONLY_PASSWORD = 'view123'
```

### Step 3: Change the Passwords

Replace with your own secure passwords:

```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourSecureAdminPassword2025!'
const READONLY_PASSWORD = 'YourReadOnlyPassword2025!'
```

**Password Recommendations:**
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common words or patterns
- Don't use personal information
- Make them different from each other

### Step 4: Rebuild the Application

After changing passwords, rebuild:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Remove Development Info Box

Before deploying to production, remove the yellow development info box that displays passwords:

In `src/components/Login.jsx`, delete or comment out this entire section (around line 80-90):

```javascript
{/* Password Info for Development - Remove in production */}
<div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 bg-yellow-100 ...">
  ...entire yellow box code...
</div>
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. **Session Persistence**
- Users stay logged in until they click "Logout"
- Authentication state stored in localStorage
- Automatic login on page refresh (if previously authenticated)

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**
- User role (admin/readonly) checked on every action
- UI elements hidden based on permissions
- Import functionality restricted to admin only

### 3. **Client-Side Protection**
- Password validation happens before app access
- No data modifications possible for read-only users
- All sensitive actions require admin role

## üö® Important Security Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Client-Side Authentication

This application uses **client-side authentication**, which means:

1. **Passwords are stored in the source code** (JavaScript file)
2. **Tech-savvy users could potentially bypass** the login by inspecting code
3. **Not suitable for highly sensitive data** or public-facing applications
4. **Best for internal team use** where users are trusted

### ‚úÖ When This Security Level is Appropriate

- Internal company tools
- Small team collaboration (5-20 people)
- Non-sensitive construction project data
- Trusted user environment
- Quick deployment without backend infrastructure

### üîí For Enhanced Security

If you need stronger security, consider:

1. **Backend Authentication**
   - Implement a Node.js/Express backend
   - Use JWT tokens or session-based auth
   - Store passwords hashed in a database
   - Validate permissions server-side

2. **Third-Party Authentication**
   - Integrate Auth0, Firebase Auth, or AWS Cognito
   - Use OAuth/SSO (Google, Microsoft)
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Store passwords in environment variables
   - Use build-time injection
   - Never commit passwords to GitHub

---

## üìù Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Change default passwords immediately**
2. **Share passwords securely** (use password managers, encrypted channels)
3. **Don't commit passwords to GitHub** (they're in the code, so use private repos)
4. **Rotate passwords periodically** (every 3-6 months)
5. **Limit admin access** to only those who need it
6. **Export data regularly** for backup
7. **Remove development info box** before deployment

### For Users

1. **Don't share your password** with unauthorized people
2. **Log out when finished**, especially on shared computers
3. **Use the Export feature** to backup important data
4. **Report suspicious activity** to the administrator

---

## üîÑ Password Reset Process

Since there's no "forgot password" feature, if someone forgets their password:

1. **Administrator** must update the password in the code
2. Rebuild the application: `npm run build`
3. Redeploy the updated version
4. Share the new password securely with the user

---

## üåê Deployment Security

### GitHub Pages / Static Hosting

When deploying to GitHub Pages or similar:

1. **Use a private repository** if possible
2. **Don't commit passwords in plain text** to public repos
3. **Consider using environment variables** during build
4. **Share the deployed URL only** with authorized users
5. **Monitor access logs** if available

### Recommended: Environment Variables

For better security, use environment variables:

#### Step 1: Create `.env` file (don't commit to Git)

```env
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword
VITE_READONLY_PASSWORD=YourReadOnlyPassword
```

#### Step 2: Update Login.jsx

```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'admin123'
const READONLY_PASSWORD = import.meta.env.VITE_READONLY_PASSWORD || 'view123'
```

#### Step 3: Add to .gitignore

```
.env
.env.local
```

## üîç Monitoring & Auditing

### Track User Activity

Consider adding logging for:
- Login attempts (successful/failed)
- Data modifications (who changed what)
- Export/import actions
- Logout events

### Example: Add to Login.jsx

```javascript
const handleLogin = (role) => {
  console.log(`User logged in as ${role} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`)
  setIsAuthenticated(true)
  setUserRole(role)
  localStorage.setItem('construction_auth', 'true')
  localStorage.setItem('construction_role', role)
  localStorage.setItem('construction_last_login', new Date().toISOString())
}
```

## üìû Support & Questions

### Common Issues

**Q: I forgot the admin password**
A: You must update it in the source code (`src/components/Login.jsx`) and rebuild

**Q: Can I add more users with different passwords?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to modify the Login component to support multiple user accounts

**Q: Is this secure enough for production?**
A: For internal team use with trusted users, yes. For public or highly sensitive data, implement backend authentication

**Q: Can read-only users see the passwords in the code?**
A: Yes, if they inspect the JavaScript files. This is a limitation of client-side auth

**Q: How do I add a third access level?**
A: Modify the Login component to add another password and role, then update all components to handle the new role
