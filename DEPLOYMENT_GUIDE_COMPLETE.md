---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Git installed on your computer
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type: git --version

2. GitHub account created
   - You already have this: juruk

3. Application files extracted to C:\PRVA
   - Download the ZIP file I provided
   - Extract all contents to C:\PRVA folder

---

## Step 1: Verify Your Local Folder

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to C:\PRVA
3. You should see these folders and files:
   - dist/ folder (contains the built application)
   - src/ folder (contains source code)
   - node_modules/ folder (if present)
   - package.json file
   - vite.config.js file
   - README.md file
   - Other documentation files

---

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository (If Not Already Created)

If you haven't created the repository yet:

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Log in with your account (juruk)
3. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
4. Select "New repository"
5. Enter repository details:
   - Repository name: prva
   - Description: Construction Project Management System
   - Visibility: Choose Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - DO NOT check "Initialize with README"
   - DO NOT add .gitignore or license yet
6. Click "Create repository"

If the repository already exists at https://github.com/juruk/prva:
- You can skip this step and proceed to Step 3

---

## Step 3: Initialize Git in Your Local Folder

1. Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell)
   - Press Windows + R
   - Type cmd and press Enter

2. Navigate to your project folder:

cd C:\PRVA

3. Initialize Git repository:

git init

4. Configure Git with your information (if not already done):

git config user.name "juruk"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

(Replace with your actual email address used on GitHub)

---

## Step 4: Update Repository Configuration

Since the application was configured for a generic repository name, we need to update it for your specific repository:

1. Open the file C:\PRVA\vite.config.js in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)

2. Find this line:
   base: '/construction-pm-app/',

3. Change it to:
   base: '/prva/',

4. Save the file

---

## Step 5: Rebuild the Application

Since we changed the configuration, we need to rebuild:

1. Make sure you're still in C:\PRVA in Command Prompt

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

npm install

3. Rebuild the application:

npm run build

4. Wait for the build to complete (should take 10-30 seconds)

---

## Step 6: Prepare Files for Git

1. Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files. Run these commands one by one:

echo node_modules/ > .gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
echo dist/.git >> .gitignore

2. Add all files to Git:

git add .

3. Create your first commit:

git commit -m "Initial commit: Construction Project Manager"

---

## Step 7: Connect to GitHub Repository

1. Add your GitHub repository as the remote:

git remote add origin https://github.com/juruk/prva.git

2. Verify the remote was added:

git remote -v

You should see:
origin  https://github.com/juruk/prva.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/juruk/prva.git (push)

---

## Step 8: Push Code to GitHub

1. Push your code to GitHub:

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

2. If prompted for credentials:
   - Username: juruk
   - Password: Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

To create a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "Construction PM App"
   - Select scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
   - Use this token as your password when pushing

3. Wait for the push to complete

4. Verify on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/juruk/prva
   - You should see all your files

---

## Step 9: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Now we'll deploy the dist folder to GitHub Pages:

1. Navigate to the dist folder:

cd dist

2. Initialize Git in the dist folder:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Construction PM App"

3. Push to the gh-pages branch:

git branch -M gh-pages
git remote add origin https://github.com/juruk/prva.git
git push -f origin gh-pages

4. Go back to the main folder:

cd ..

---

## Step 10: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/juruk/prva

2. Click on "Settings" tab (top menu)

3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"

4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: Select "gh-pages"
   - Folder: Select "/ (root)"

5. Click "Save"

6. Wait 1-3 minutes for deployment

7. Refresh the page - you should see:
   "Your site is live at https://juruk.github.io/prva/"

---

## Step 11: Access Your Live Application

1. Open your browser

2. Go to: https://juruk.github.io/prva/

3. You should see the login screen for your Construction Project Manager!

4. Log in with:
   - Admin: admin123
   - Read-Only: view123

---

## Success!

Your Construction Project Manager is now live at:
https://juruk.github.io/prva/

You can share this URL with your team members!

## Updating Your Application

When you make changes and want to update the live site:

1. Make your changes in C:\PRVA

2. Rebuild the application:

cd C:\PRVA
npm run build

3. Commit and push changes to main branch:

git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main

4. Deploy the updated dist folder:

cd dist
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy updates"
git push -f origin gh-pages
cd ..

5. Wait 1-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

6. Refresh https://juruk.github.io/prva/ to see changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing

Solution: You need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password.
- Follow the instructions in Step 8 to create a token
- Use the token as your password when Git asks for credentials

### Issue: "Repository not found"

Solution: Make sure the repository exists at https://github.com/juruk/prva
- Check that you're logged in as juruk
- Verify the repository name is exactly prva (lowercase)

### Issue: 404 error when accessing the live site

Solution:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (Step 10)
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for initial deployment
3. Check that the gh-pages branch exists in your repository
4. Verify the base in vite.config.js is set to /prva/

### Issue: Application loads but shows errors

Solution:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify the base path in vite.config.js matches your repository name
4. Rebuild and redeploy

### Issue: Changes not appearing on live site

Solution:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
3. Try accessing in incognito/private browsing mode
4. Verify you pushed to the gh-pages branch

## Security Reminders

Before Sharing with Your Team:

1. Change Default Passwords
   - Edit C:\PRVA\src\components\Login.jsx
   - Find the ADMIN_PASSWORD and READONLY_PASSWORD constants
   - Change admin123 and view123 to your own secure passwords
   - Rebuild and redeploy

2. Remove Development Info Box
   - Edit C:\PRVA\src\components\Login.jsx
   - Remove or comment out the development password display section
   - Rebuild and redeploy

3. Data Backup
   - Regularly export your data using the "Export Data" button
   - Store backups in a secure location
   - Consider setting up the optional GitHub backup system

## Optional: Set Up Automatic Deployment

For easier updates, you can set up a script:

1. Create a file C:\PRVA\deploy.bat with this content:

@echo off
echo Building application...
call npm run build

echo Deploying to GitHub Pages...
cd dist
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: %date% %time%"
git push -f origin gh-pages
cd ..

echo Deployment complete!
echo Your site will be updated at https://juruk.github.io/prva/ in 1-3 minutes
pause

2. Save the file

3. To deploy updates, just double-click deploy.bat
