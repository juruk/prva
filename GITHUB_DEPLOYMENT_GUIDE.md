# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 📦 Complete Step-by-Step Instructions

This guide will help you deploy your Construction Project Manager application to GitHub Pages for **free hosting**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **GitHub Account** - Create one at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
2. **Git Installed** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) if needed
3. **Application Files** - You already have these in the `/home/ubuntu/construction-pm-app` directory

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name**: `construction-pm-app` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Construction Project Management Application"
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Download Your Application Files

You need to download the application files from this sandbox to your local computer:

**Option A: Download as ZIP**
1. I'll create a ZIP file for you to download
2. Extract the ZIP on your computer
3. Navigate to the extracted folder in your terminal

**Option B: Use the file browser**
1. Download the entire `/home/ubuntu/construction-pm-app` folder
2. Save it to your local computer
3. Navigate to that folder in your terminal

### Step 3: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the `construction-pm-app` folder, then run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd construction-pm-app

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Construction Project Manager"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual values
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
If your GitHub username is `johnsmith` and repository name is `construction-pm-app`:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/construction-pm-app.git
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/dist`
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

GitHub will automatically deploy your application. This usually takes 1-3 minutes.

You'll see a message like:
> "Your site is live at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/"

### Step 6: Access Your Application

Your application will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```

**Example:**
```
https://johnsmith.github.io/construction-pm-app/
```

---

## 🔄 Updating Your Application

Whenever you make changes and want to update the deployed version:

```bash
# Make your changes to the code

# Rebuild the application
npm run build

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy within 1-3 minutes.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

### Base Path Configuration

The application is configured with `base: './'` in `vite.config.js`, which works for most GitHub Pages deployments.

**If your application doesn't load correctly**, you may need to update the base path:

1. Open `vite.config.js`
2. Change the `base` value:
   ```javascript
   base: '/YOUR_REPO_NAME/',
   ```
3. Rebuild and redeploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix base path"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain instead of `username.github.io`:

1. Purchase a domain from a domain registrar
2. In your repository settings, go to **Pages**
3. Under **"Custom domain"**, enter your domain
4. Configure your domain's DNS settings (instructions provided by GitHub)

---

## 📁 What Gets Deployed

Only the **`/dist`** folder gets deployed to GitHub Pages. This folder contains:

- Optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- All necessary assets and dependencies
- Production-ready build of your application

The source code remains in the repository but is not publicly accessible through the website.

---

## 🔒 Data Storage & Privacy

**Important Notes:**

1. **Data is stored locally** in each user's browser (localStorage)
2. **No backend server** - the application is completely client-side
3. **Each user has their own data** - data is not shared between users
4. **Use Export/Import** to share data between team members
5. **GitHub only hosts the code** - your project data is NOT stored on GitHub

### Sharing Data with Team Members

To share your project data:

1. Click **"Export Data"** in the application
2. Share the JSON file with your team (via email, cloud storage, etc.)
3. Team members click **"Import Data"** to load the data

You can also store the data JSON file in a **separate private GitHub repository** for team access.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Application shows blank page

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Verify the `base` path in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name
3. Rebuild and redeploy

### Issue: Styles not loading

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Check that all files in `/dist` were committed to GitHub
3. Verify GitHub Pages is set to deploy from `/dist` folder

### Issue: "404 - Page not found"

**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
2. Verify the repository is public
3. Check that the `/dist` folder exists and contains `index.html`

### Issue: Changes not appearing

**Solution:**
1. Verify you ran `npm run build` before pushing
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 1-3 minutes for GitHub to redeploy
4. Try accessing in incognito/private browsing mode
