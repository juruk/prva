## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing

**Solution**: You need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password.

- Follow the instructions in Step 8 to create a token

- Use the token as your password when Git asks for credentials

### Issue: "Repository not found"

**Solution**: Make sure the repository exists at [https://github.com/juruk/prva](https://github.com/juruk/prva)

- Check that you're logged in as `juruk`

### Issue: Changes not appearing on live site

**Solution**:

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)

1. Wait 3-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
