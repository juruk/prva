# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix

## The Error You Got

```
Missing environment. Ensure your workflow's deployment job has an environment.
```

This means the workflow file was missing the `environment` specification.

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECTED WORKFLOW FILE

Replace the content of your `deploy.yml` file with this **CORRECTED VERSION**:

### File Location:
`C:\PRVA\construction-pm-app\.github\workflows\deploy.yml`

### Corrected Content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## üéØ What Was Added

The key addition is the `environment` section:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:              # ‚Üê THIS WAS MISSING
      name: github-pages      # ‚Üê THIS WAS MISSING
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}  # ‚Üê THIS WAS MISSING
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Also added `concurrency` to prevent multiple deployments at once:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## üîç How to Check If It Worked

### Check 1: Workflow File on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/juruk/prva/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

You should see the `environment:` section in the file.

### Check 2: Actions Tab
Go to: https://github.com/juruk/prva/actions

The latest workflow run should show:
- ‚úì Green checkmark (success)
- "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow name

### Check 3: Your Live Site
Go to: https://juruk.github.io/prva/

You should see:
- The login page
- NOT a blank screen
- NOT a 404 error

---

## üÜò If It Still Fails

### Check the Error Message

1. Go to: https://github.com/juruk/prva/actions
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Click on the "deploy" job
4. Look for red error messages

### Common Issues:

**Issue: "npm install" fails**
- Make sure `package.json` is in the repository
- Check that it has all dependencies listed

**Issue: "npm run build" fails**
- Make sure `vite.config.js` is in the repository
- Test `npm run build` locally first

**Issue: Still says "Missing environment"**
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE corrected workflow
- Check that the indentation is correct (YAML is sensitive to spaces)
