# Contact Information Update

## ✅ Latest Improvement Completed

### Architect and Contractor Contact Information in Projects

The project detail pages now display **complete contact information** for all assigned architects and contractors, making it easy to reach team members directly from the project view without navigating to their individual pages.

---

## 📧 What's New

### Architects Section

When viewing a project, each assigned architect now displays:

- **Name**: Full name of the architect
- **Company**: Company name (e.g., "Johnson Design Studio")
- **Email**: 📧 Email address (e.g., "sarah.johnson@designstudio.com")
- **Phone**: 📞 Phone number (e.g., "+1 (555) 234-5678")

All information is displayed in a clean, organized card format with emoji icons for easy visual scanning.

### Contractors Section

Similarly, each assigned contractor displays:

- **Name**: Full name of the contractor
- **Company**: Company name
- **Specialty**: Color-coded badge showing their field (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC, etc.)
- **Email**: 📧 Email address
- **Phone**: 📞 Phone number

## 🎯 Benefits

This improvement provides several key advantages for project management:

**Quick Access to Contact Information**: You no longer need to navigate away from the project page to find contact details for team members. All essential information is displayed directly on the project page.

**Improved Communication**: Having email and phone numbers readily visible makes it faster to reach out to architects and contractors when questions or issues arise during project execution.

**Better Project Overview**: The project page now serves as a comprehensive hub showing not just what needs to be done, but also who is responsible and how to contact them.

**Professional Presentation**: The clean card layout with emoji icons makes contact information easy to scan and visually appealing, maintaining the professional aesthetic of the application.

## 📱 Display Format

The contact information is displayed using a hierarchical layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sarah Johnson                       │
│ Johnson Design Studio               │
│ 📧 sarah.johnson@designstudio.com  │
│ 📞 +1 (555) 234-5678               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For contractors, the specialty badge appears alongside the company name:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Elite Electrical Services           │
│ Elite Construction Co. [Electrical] │
│ 📧 contact@eliteelectrical.com     │
│ 📞 +1 (555) 987-6543               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
